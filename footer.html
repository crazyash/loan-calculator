        <p>A fixed deposit (FD) is a financial instrument provided by banks or NBFCs which provides investors a higher
            rate of interest than a regular savings account, until the given maturity date. It may or may not require
            the creation of a separate account. It is known as a term deposit or time deposit in Canada, Australia, New
            Zealand, and the US, and as a bond in the United Kingdom and India.
            <br /><br /> For a fixed deposit is that the
            money
            cannot be withdrawn from the FD as compared to a recurring deposit or a demand deposit before maturity. Some
            banks may offer additional services to FD holders such as loans against FD certificates at competitive
            interest rates.
            <br /><br /> It's important to note that banks may offer lesser interest rates under uncertain
            economic
            conditions. The interest rate varies between 4 and 7.50 percent. The tenure of an FD can vary from 7, 15
            or 45 days to 1.5 years and can be as high as 10 years. These investments are safer than Post Office
            Schemes as they are covered by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC).

    <div id="recurring_deposit" class="tabcontent">
        <p>A recurring deposit is a special kind of term deposit offered by banks in India which help people with
            regular incomes to deposit a fixed amount every month into their recurring deposit account and earn interest
            at the rate applicable to fixed deposits. It is similar to making fixed deposits of a certain amount in
            monthly installments. This deposit matures on a specific date in the future along with all the deposits made
            every month. Recurring deposit schemes allow customers an opportunity to build up their savings through
            regular monthly deposits of a fixed sum over a fixed period of time. The minimum period of a recurring
            deposit is six months and the maximum is ten years.
            <br /><br />
            The recurring deposit can be funded by standing instructions which are the instructions by the customer to
            the bank to withdraw a certain sum of money from his savings/current account and debit to the recurring
            deposit account.
            <br /><br />
            When the recurring deposit account is opened, the maturity value is indicated to the customer assuming that
            the monthly installments will be paid regularly on due dates. If any installment is delayed, the interest
            payable in the account will be reduced and will not be sufficient to reach the maturity value. Therefore,
            the difference in interest will be deducted from the maturity value as a penalty. The rate of penalty will
            be fixed upfront. Interest is compounded on quarterly basis in recurring deposits.
            <br /><br />
            One can avail loans against the collateral of a recurring deposit up to 80 to 90% of the deposit value.

        <p>A systematic investment plan (SIP) is an investment vehicle offered by mutual funds to investors, allowing
            them to invest small amounts periodically instead of lump sums. The frequency of investment is usually
            weekly, monthly or quarterly.
            <br /><br />
            In SIPs, a fixed amount of money is debited by the investors in bank accounts periodically and invested in a
            specified mutual fund. The investor is allocated a number of units according to the current Net asset value.
            Every time a sum is invested, more units are added to the investors account.
            <br /><br />
            The strategy claims to free the investors from speculating in volatile markets by dollar cost averaging. As
            the investor is getting more units when the price is low and fewer units when the price is high, in the long
            run, the average cost per unit is supposed to be lower.
            <br /><br />
            SIP claims to encourage disciplined investment. SIPs are flexible; the investors may stop investing a plan
            anytime or may choose to increase or decrease the investment amount. SIP is usually recommended to retail
            investors who do not have the resources to pursue the active investment.

            An EMI or Equated Monthly Installment is defined by Investopedia as "A fixed payment amount made by a
            borrower to a lender at a specified date each calendar month. Equated monthly installments are used to pay
            off both interest and principal each month, so that over a specified number of years, the loan is fully paid
            off along with interest."
            <br /><br />
            It further explains that, with most common types of loans, such as real estate mortgages, the borrower makes
            fixed periodic payments to the lender over the course of several years with the goal of retiring the loan.
            EMIs differ from variable payment plans, in which the borrower is able to pay higher payment amounts at his
            or her discretion. In EMI plans, borrowers are mostly only allowed one fixed payment amount each month.
            <br /><br />
            The benefit of an EMI for borrowers is that they know precisely how much money they will need to pay toward
            their loan each month, making the personal budgeting process easier.
